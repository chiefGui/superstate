# React
Integrating **superstate** with React is easy.

First you have to install `@superstate/react`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bash" label="npm">

```bash
npm install @superstate/react
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @superstate/react
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then you'll be able to import the `useSuperState` hook:

<Code files={{ '/App.tsx': `import { superstate } from '@superstate/core'\nimport { useSuperState } from '@superstate/react'
\nconst count = superstate(0)
\nexport default function App() {
\  useSuperState(count)\n
\  return (
    <div>
      Count is <strong>{count.now()}</strong><br/>\n
      <button onClick={() => count.publish(prev => prev - 1)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => count.publish(prev => prev + 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  )
\}` }} />

## Targeting specific state version

By default, the `useSuperState` hook will re-render your React component whenever either `now` or `draft` change.
However, sometimes you want to monitor only changes made to the `draft` instead. To do so, all you have to do is
specifying `draft` as a `useSuperState` target:

<div style={{ paddingBottom: '1rem' }}>
<Code files={{ '/App.tsx': `import { superstate } from '@superstate/core'\nimport { useSuperState } from '@superstate/react'
\nconst count = superstate(0)\n
export default function App() {
\  useSuperState(count, { target: 'draft' }) // this line!\n
\  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => count.set(prev => prev - 1)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => count.set(prev => prev + 1)}>+</button>\n
\
      {typeof count.draft() !== 'undefined' &&
        <section>
          Count's draft is: <strong>{count.draft()}</strong><br/>
        </section>
      }
    </div>
  )
\}` }} />
</div>

If you want to target only `now` version instead of both `now` and `draft`, just pass `now` to `target`.

## Smart re-renders
It may sound dangerous to always re-render your component whenever a state changes, but don't worry&mdash;a re-render will
only occur when changes are broadcasted, and changes are only broadcasted when the new state is actually different from the
previous state.

Meaning that:

```typescript
const count = superstate(0)
count.publish(5) // will trigger a re-render
count.publish(5) // will NOT trigger a re-render
count.publish(5) // will NOT trigger a re-render
count.publish(prev => prev) // will NOT trigger a re-render
count.publish(prev => prev + 1) // will trigger a re-render

const user = superstate({ name: 'John' })
user.publish(prev => prev) // will NOT trigger a re-render
user.publish(prev => ({ name: 'Doe' })) // will trigger a re-render
```

*Currently, custom logic to trigger broadcasts/re-render is not supported.*


## Components rendering twice

If your component is rendering twice upon a **superstate** state change, it may be because of React's `<StrictMode />`.
Just to make sure, unwrap your app from `<StrictMode />` and try changing the state again.

In case the problem doesn't persist, don't worry&mdash;this doubled re-render is only happening in development mode and it's intentional [(learn more)](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#detecting-unexpected-side-effects);
otherwise, [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/chiefGui/superstate).
