# TypeScript
**superstate** is entirely written in TypeScript, so there's no need for additional setup or steps to get started.

### Explicitly typing the value of a superstate
```typescript
const user = superstate<User>({
  id: 'asdf',
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@doe.com'
})

interface User {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
}
```
