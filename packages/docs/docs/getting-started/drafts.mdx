# Drafts
One of the key and most opionionated feature of **superstate** is the built-in draft management.
Drafts are preliminatory versions of your state that you are free to mutate without impacting
the final user.

To illustrate the concept of drafts to you: when you're typing a text message to someone, the said text is just
a draft as long as you don't submit it. While the text is just a draft, you're free to change it as much as you like.

## Creating a draft
There are two ways of changing the "value" of a `superstate`:

```typescript
const count = superstate(0)

count.set(5)
```

In the example above, by calling `.set(5)`, only the `.draft()` version of `count` will be changed.

```typescript
const count = superstate(0)

count.publish(5)
```

In the other hand though, `.publish(5)` will eliminate whatever you have in the `.draft()` of `count` and assign `5` to `.now()`,
which corresponds to the value you want your users to see.

### Updating an existing draft
```typescript
const count = superstate(0)

count.set(5) // `.draft()` will be 5
count.set(10) // `.draft()` will be 10
count.set(prev => prev + 1) // `.draft()` will be 11
```

:::warning
Always prefer to [`.discard()`](#discarding-a-draft) a draft when you no longer want it instead of `.set(undefined)` because
`.discard()` does more than just set the draft's value to `undefined`.

However, for whatever reason, if you literally just want the `.draft()` to become `undefined`, feel free to `.set(undefined)`.
:::

## Reading a draft

To display the draft version of a superstate, you simply call `.draft()`:

```typescript
const count = superstate(0)

count.set(20)

console.log(count.draft()) // logs 20
```


## Publishing a draft

When you change the value of a draft (by calling `.set(5)`, for example), this change is intentionally not propagated to `.now()` and only exists in `.draft()`.
In order to publish it, guess what, you gotta call `.publish()`:

```typescript
const count = superstate(0)

count.set(20)
count.publish()
```

After you call `.publish()`, **superstate** will do two things:

1. Assign `.draft()` to `.now()`,
2. dispose the value of `.draft()`, making it become `undefined`.

### Discarding a draft
Let's say you made changes to your draft but in the end you changed your mind. Super fine&mdash;discarding drafts is simple:

```typescript
const count = superstate(0)

count.set(10)
count.discard() // Nah, 10 is not enough!

count.set(20)
count.publish() // Yeah, 20 it is!
```

## Monitoring draft changes
If you like to do something whenever a draft changes, you can subscribe to your state's draft by passing `'draft'` as the second argument
of the `.subscribe()` function:

```typescript
const count = superstate(0)

count.subscribe(value => {
  console.log(value)
}, 'draft')
```

:::info
By default, `.subscribe()` will only listen to `.now()` changes.
:::

If you no longer want to listen to draft changes:

```typescript
const count = superstate(0)
const unsubscribe = count.subscribe(console.log, 'draft')

unsubscribe()

// Now, you can safely mutate the draft that
// no changes will be broadcasted.
```

### What changes are broadcasted?

Changes are only broadcasted if the new value of the draft is different from the previous value. With that in mind:

- Whenever `.set(value)` is called,
- and/or whenever `.publish()` is called,
- and/or whenever `.discard()` is called.

:::info
No matter how complex the value of `draft()` is, **superstate** will deep compare the previous value with the next value,
to make sure changes are only broadcasted when needed.
:::

## `undefined` drafts

If your state doesn't have a draft version, `undefined` will be returned when trying to read it through `.draft()`:

```typescript
const count = superstate(0)

console.log(count.draft()) // logs `undefined`
```

You might be wondering why and/or when a draft is `undefined`. Well, the idea is that `superstate` aims to be as respectful
as possible with your user's memory usage. In short, **superstate** only issues
drafts when needed and disposes them when no longer needed.

### Draft disposal

`.draft()` will return `undefined` when:

- You haven't `.set()` anything,
- after you call `.discard()` or
- after you call `.publish()`.
