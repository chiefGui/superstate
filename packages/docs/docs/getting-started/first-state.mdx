# Your first superstate

It's time to have fun. Let's create a superstate that stores a number:

```typescript
import { superstate } from '@superstate/core'

const count = superstate(0)
```

To display what `count` looks like:

```typescript
console.log(count.now()) // logs 0
```

And to change what `count` should be:

```typescript
count.set(5)

console.log(count.now()) // logs 5
```

## A more real-world example

```ts
const user = {
  state: superstate({
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    role: 'user',
    posts: []
  }),

  rename: (firstName: string, lastName: string) => user.state.set({ firstName, lastName }),
  promote: (newRole: Role) => user.state.set({ role: newRole }),
  post: (newPost: Post) => user.state.set({ posts: [...user.state.now().posts, newPost] }),

  fullName: () => `${user.state.now().firstName} ${user.state.now().lastName}`,
  isAdmin: () => user.state.now().role === Role.Admin
  getPostsAmount: () => user.state.now().posts.length
}

enum Role {
  Admin = 'admin',
  Role = 'role'
}

interface User {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  role: Role
  posts: Post[]
}

interface Post {
  id: string
  title: string
}
```

:::info
TypeScript in often used in the exmaples, but it's not required. If you're using vanilla JavaScript, just
ignore all the interfaces, enums, etc.
:::

Now you can do things like:

```ts
user.rename('Jane Doe')
user.promote(Role.Admin)
user.post({ id: '1', title: 'Hello world' })

console.log(user.fullName()) // logs `Jane Doe`
console.log(user.isAdmin()) // logs `true`
console.log(user.getPostsAmount()) // logs `1`
```

And if you want to monitor when the state changes:

```ts
user.state.subscribe((state) => {
  alert('Hey! The user state changed!')
})
```

:::info React?
If you want to do something inside a React component when the state changes, please read our [React documentation](/getting-started/react).

## Technical Overview

Under the hood, what **superstate** does is wrapping your state within a variable and
enforcing queries and mutations to happen respectively through the `.now()` and `.set()` methods.

This allows **superstate** to keep track of what's going on with your state, and to keep your
app posted about changes made to it as well.
