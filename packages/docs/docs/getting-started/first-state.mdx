# Your first superstate

It's time to have fun. Let's create a superstate that stores a number:

```typescript
import { superstate } from '@superstate/core'

const count = superstate(0)
```

To display what `count` looks like:

```typescript
console.log(count.now()) // logs 0
```

And to change what `count` should be:

```typescript
count.set(5)

console.log(count.now()) // logs 5
```

**superstate** allows more complex objects as well:

```ts
const user = superstate({
  name: 'John Doe',
  role: 'admin',
  posts: [
    { id: '1', title: 'Hello world' },
    { id: '2', title: 'World hello' }
  ]
})
```

And if you want to edit the role of the `user` (or really, any other property):

```ts {3}
console.log(user.now().role) // logs 'admin'

user.set(prev => ({ ...prev, role: 'editor' }))

console.log(user.now().role) // logs 'editor'
```

Believe it or not: that's it! Now go build something awesome!

## Technical Overview

Under the hood, what **superstate** does is wrapping your state within a variable and
enforcing queries and mutations to happen respectively through the `.now()` and `.set()` methods.

This allows **superstate** to keep track of what's going on with your state, and to keep your
app posted about changes made to it as well.
