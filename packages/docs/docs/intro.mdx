# Introduction
It feels like the JavaScript ecosystem always had a gap when it comes to state management:
some libraries are way too verbose and boilerplate-y; some others only work with React or Vue or &laquo;
place your framework here &raquo;. Some target too basic, prototype-y applications and don't give comfort to scale
and/or care about it at all.

**superstate** is an attempt to fill these gaps, featuring an elegant,
friendly to beginners and charming to veterans API, and being just enough opinionated to
make you as productive as you can be.

## What makes superstate different?

### Built-in Drafts
Imagine you are building a blog system and you want your users to be able to confere the changes
they made to their posts before going live. Now imagine that you can give them this functionality
where the only effort would be building the fun part: the user interface. That's where drafts come in.

### Works in any JavaScript application
As long as your application is powered by JavaScript (or TypeScript), **superstate**
will just work&mdash;and this includes hassle-free SSR interoperability.

### Extensible
**superstate** offers all the power a small application needs to be built out of the box. When you're ready to go big,
extend your state mechanics to fit the needs of a behemoth.

### Easy to learn, easy to master
Working with **superstate** has to be as easy as in the examples, to both get started and scale.
