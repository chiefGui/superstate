## Motivation

It feels like the JavaScript ecosystem always had a gap when it comes to state management:
some libraries are way too verbose and boilerplate-y; some others only work with React or Vue or &laquo;
place your framework here &raquo;. Some target too basic, prototype-y applications and don't give comfort to scale
and/or care about it at all.

**superstate** is an attempt to fill these gaps, featuring an elegant,
friendly to beginners and charming to veterans API, and being just enough opinionated to
make you as productive as you can be.
