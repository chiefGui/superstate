# Automatic localStorage persistency

Install the `@superstate/adapters` package:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bash" label="npm">

```bash
npm install @superstate/adapters
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @superstate/adapters
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


And plug the `ls` adapter into your **superstate**:

```typescript {4-6}
import { superstate } from '@superstate/core'
import { ls } from '@superstate/adapters'

const count = superstate(0).use([
  ls('count') // 'count' is the localStorage key
])
```

Now, whenever `now` changes, its value will be persisted against the `localStorage`:

```typescript
count.set(5)

console.log(localStorage.getItem('count')) // logs 5
```

## Initial value

When `ls` is plugged into your state, its initial value will be whatever is stored in the `localStorage` under the key you specified. For example:

```typescript
localStorage.setItem('count', 5)

const count = superstate(0).use([
  ls('count') // 'count' is the key
])

console.log(count.now()) // logs 5
```

## Limitations

- Currently, only `JSON.stringify()`-able objects can be persisted.
- The `ls` adapter will not persist `draft` state.
