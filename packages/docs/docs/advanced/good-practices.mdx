# Good Practices

## Mutating the state based on its previous value

You don't want to use `count.now()` when referring to the previous value of your state when
mutating it because depending on how you program your application, that value may be inaccurate, i.e.
in asynchronous contexts.

The safest way to update your state based on its previous value is passing a function to `.set()`, where
the first argument is the current value of your state and making its return to be the next value you want
your state to be.

❌ **Don't:**
```typescript
const count = superstate(0)

count.set(count.now() + 1)
```

✅ **Do:**
```typescript
const count = superstate(0)

count.set(prev => prev + 1)
```

## Abstract complex logic with Extensions

It's tempting to just rush and use the built-in methods to handle your state. They work. However, it may become unsustainable at some point if
you don't abstract complex, not obvious logic into small, organized pieces. [Extensions](/getting-started/extensions) are here for you.

❌ **Don't:**
```typescript
const user = superstate({ firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', slug: 'john-doe' })

user.set(prev => ({
  ...prev,

  firstName: 'Hello',
  lastName: 'World',
  slug: slugify('Hello World')
}))
```

✅ **Do:**
```typescript
function rename({ set }, { firstName, lastName }) {
  set(prev => {
    ...prev,

    firstName,
    lastName,
    slug: slugify(`${firstName} ${lastName}`)
  })
}

const user =
  superstate({ firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', slug: 'john-doe' })
    .extend({ rename })

user.rename({ firstName: 'Hello', lastName: 'World' })
```

:::info Types!
Extensions are seamlessly integrated with TypeScript. They show up in your editor's autocomplete as well as their arguments. Take advantage of it!

## Keep your state serializable

Don't populate your superstates with non-serializable data, such as function, classes, etc.
**superstate** expects its contents to be as agnostic as possible, so data can be handled
in an unopinionated fashion. For example, [localStorage persistency](/advanced/local-storage) wouldn't be
possible out of the box if data was not serializable. [Learn more.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization)

❌ **Don't:**
```ts {5-7}
const user = superstate({
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  slug: 'john-doe',
  save() {
    // Your save function.
  }
})
```

✅ **Do:**
```ts {1,2,3,9}
function save() {
  // Your save function.
}

const user = superstate({
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  slug: 'john-doe'
}).extend({ save })
```
