# Good Practices

## Mutating the state based on its previous value

❌ **Don't:**
```typescript
const count = superstate(0)

count.publish(count + 1)
```

✅ **Do:**
```typescript
const count = superstate(0)

count.publish(prev => prev + 1)
```

## Abstract complex logic with Extensions

It's tempting to just rush and use the built-in methods to handle your state. They work. However, it may become unsustainable at some point if
you don't abstract complex, not obvious logic into small, organized pieces. [Extensions](/getting-started/extensions) are here for you.

❌ **Don't:**
```typescript
const user = superstate({ firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', slug: 'john-doe' })

user.publish(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  firstName: 'Hello',
  lastName: 'World',
  slug: slugify('Hello World')
}))
```

✅ **Do:**
```typescript
function rename({ publish }, { firstName, lastName }) {
  publish(prev => {
    ...prev,

    firstName,
    lastName,
    slug: slugify(`${firstName} ${lastName}`)
  })
}

const user =
  superstate({ firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', slug: 'john-doe' })
    .extend({ rename })

user.rename({ firstName: 'Hello', lastName: 'World' })
```

:::info Types!
Extensions are seamlessly integrated with TypeScript. They show up in your editor's autocomplete as well as their arguments. Take advantage of it!
