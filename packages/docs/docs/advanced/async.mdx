# Async

Currently, **superstate** does not have anything built-in to automate the work with asynchronous data.
This is an intentional decision because I believe it may not be needed at all.

Allow me to clarify. I don't think this:

```ts
const count = superstate(0)

async function init() {
  const response = await API.get('/count')

  count.set(response.count)
}

init()
```

Is worse than this:

```ts
// For those who skipped the text on this page:
// the snippet below DOES NOT work!
// Please, read the page to understand why.

const count = superstate(async () => await API.get('count'))
```

And if you go a little creative, you can have a wonderful, explicit API:

```ts
const count = {
  state: superstate(0),

  sync() {
    const response = await API.get('/count')

    this.state.set(response.count)
  },
}

function init() {
  count.sync()
}

init()
```

You know, I don't think something is being lost by skipping built-in async state. Of course we have more lines of code,
but is it really that bad? Also, it may be worth mentioning that a long-term goal of **superstate** is
[to always favor explicitness over implicitness](/about/goals), and this often means more lines of code.
But that's not necessarily a bad thing though&mdash;in this case, having full control and understanding of the code
around your state totally pays off.
