# "now" or "draft"?

At this point you may have heard of [Drafts](/getting-started/drafts), but you may not understand why exactly
they exist and why (or when) you should use them. Let's go over the basics.

**superstate**'s API is, in fact, very simple:

```typescript
const count = superstate(0)

count.set(5)
```

The above is what you would expect of any state management library: you define a state, set its initial value (`0`),
and mutate it (to `5`) when needed.

However, this is not always enough when it comes to real-life applications.

An ordinary example of a real-life application is when you want to confirm a user's action before you actually submit it.
A good example may be editting a user's profile:

<div style={{ paddingBottom: '1rem' }}>
<Code deps={{ slugify: '1.6.5' }} files={{ '/App.tsx': `import { useState } from 'react'\nimport slugify from 'slugify'\n
export default function App() {
\  const [name, setName] = useState('John Doe')
\  const [draftName, setDraftName] = useState('')
\  const [isConfirming, setIsConfirming] = useState(false)\n
\
\  return (
\    <div>
\      <section style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>
\        Hello <strong>{name}</strong>.<br/>
\        <small>@{slugify(name, { lower: true })}</small><br/>
\      </section>\n
\
\      {isConfirming && (
\        <div style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>
\          <p>
\            You sure? Your name will become <strong>{draftName}</strong> and
\            your slug will be <strong>@{slugify(draftName, { lower: true })}</strong>.
\          </p>\n
\
\          <div>
\            <button onClick={() => setIsConfirming(false)}>Cancel</button>
\            <button
\              onClick={() => {
\                setIsConfirming(false)
\                setName(draftName)
\                setDraftName('')
\              }}
\            >
\              Confirm
\            </button>
\          </div>
\        </div>
\      )}\n
\
\      <form onSubmit={async (e) => {
\        e.preventDefault()
\
\        setDraftName(e.target.elements.name.value)
\        setIsConfirming(true)
\      }}>
\        <input placeholder='Type a new name' name='name' />\n
\
\        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
\      </form>
\    </div>
\  )
\}` }} />
</div>

Although there are plenty of ways to achieve the above with less verbosity and complexity,
it'd be better if you wouldn't have to worry about it at all.

Let's see the same example with **superstate**:

<div style={{ paddingBottom: '1rem' }}>
<Code deps={{ slugify: '1.6.5' }} files={{ '/App.tsx': `import { superstate } from '@superstate/core'\nimport { useSuperState } from '@superstate/react'\nimport slugify from 'slugify'
\nconst user = superstate({ name: 'John Doe' })\n
export default function App() {
\  useSuperState(user)\n
\
\  const _user = user.now()
\  const draft = user.draft()\n
\
\  return (
    <div>
      <section style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>
        Hello <strong>{_user.name}</strong>.<br/>
        <small>@{slugify(_user.name, { lower: true })}</small>
      </section>\n
\
      {draft && (
        <div style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>
          <p>
            You sure? Your name will become <strong>{draft.name}</strong> and
            your slug will be <strong>@{slugify(draft.name, { lower: true })}</strong>.
          </p>\n
\
          <div>
            <button onClick={() => user.discard()}>Cancel</button>
            <button onClick={() => user.publish()}>Confirm</button>
          </div>
        </div>
      )}\n
\
      <form onSubmit={e => {
        e.preventDefault()
\
        user.set(prev => ({ ...prev, name: e.target.elements.name.value }))
      }}>
        <input placeholder='Type a new name' name='name' />\n
        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  )
\}` }} />
</div>

We can observe a few things from the example above:

#### Less lines of code
The same functionality was achieved with both codes. However, with **superstate** it required less lines of code and it felt
more ergonomic.

#### Easy to keep it consistent
If your app has several places where you need user's confirmation before making a change go live, you don't have to worry
about abstracting things and/or consistency. **superstate** takes care of it for you.

#### Instant better UX
Have you tried to submit the same name twice? In the example without **superstate**, it allows users to submit the same
name no matter what&mdash;you have to implement your own diff algorithm to prevent this.

In the other hand, **superstate** is smarter. It won't give false hopes to the user nor stress your API if a change wouldn't
make sense.

### The veredict

`now` and `draft` serve different purposes. `now` is meant to express the official version of your state; `draft` is meant
to represent a "work-in-progress" version of your state that may change before going live.

If your application doesn't care about giving users second chances, thus improving its usability, then don't bother
with `draft` at all. Otherwise, `draft` will be at your service.
