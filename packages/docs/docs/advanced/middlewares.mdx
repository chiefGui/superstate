# Middlewares

Middlewares are implicit methods to deal with side effects of your superstates.

Let's say we want to display an `alert` whenever a `superstate` changes. One simple way to achieve it would be through
a simple Middleware:

```ts
function myMiddleware({ eventType }) {
  if (eventType === 'after:change') {
    alert('hello world!')

    return
  }
}

const count = superstate(0).use([myMiddleware])

count.set(10) // here your `alert()` would be called
```

And honestly, Middlewares are that simple!

## Event Types

One of the most important aspects of a Middleware is the `eventType` property `superstate` passes to it. The `eventType`
helps you decide what to do and when.

Here's a list of all the available event types:

```
init
before:set
after:set
before:sketch
after:sketch
before:publish
after:publish
before:change
after:change
before:discard
after:discard
before:broadcast:now
after:broadcast:now
before:broadcast:draft
after:broadcast:draft
```

### The `init` event type

The `init` event type is executed once when a Middleware is successfully attached to a **superstate**:

```typescript
function initMiddleware({ eventType }) {
  if (eventType === 'init') {
    alert('initMiddleware was installed successfully!')

    return
  }
}

const count = superstate(0).use([initMiddleware]) // the `alert()` would be called here.
```

May be important to note that `init` won't ever be called again despite this very first time.

### `before:change` and `after:change`

Just like `init`, these `change` events are special, because it has two different instigators.

It'll be triggered when...
- you `.publish()` successfully and/or,
- you `.set()` successfully.

:::info
Note that the `change` event will not trigger for changes made to the draft. If you are interested on draft events,
please use `before:sketch` and `after:sketch`.
:::

### Before/After events

As you may have noticed, some events are prefixed with `before:` or `after:`.

These events will only trigger when an action was successfully achieved, and only before/after the action itself.

To illustrate an example, `before:publish` occurs when you call `.publish()`, but *before* the publish method has published
your changes; at the same time, `after:publish` also occurs when you call `.publish()`, except it will be executed *after*
the publish method has published your changes. Both `before:publish` and `after:publish` will only occur if publishing was successful.

## Advanced Middlewares

`eventType` is not the only property exposed to Middlewares. Actually, Middlewares have access to the exact same functions
a `superstate` object has, such as `publish`, `set`, `discard`, etc [(Learn more)](/api-reference/@superstate/core/superstate). To illustrate you an example:

```typescript
function myMiddleware({ eventType, set, now }) {
  if (eventType === 'after:publish') {
    sketch(now())
  }
}

const count = superstate(0).use([myMiddleware])

count.publish(5)
```

The Middleware above will assign your draft with the value of `now()`, which is `5`, every time you `.publish()` something.

:::danger Infinite loop!
If you call `publish()` inside a Middleware that does something after you `publish()`, expect an infinite loop. That said, don't do that!
:::

## When Middlewares make sense

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware):

> Middleware is a type of computer software that provides services to software applications beyond those available from the operating system. It can be described as "software glue".
>
> Middleware makes it easier for software developers to implement communication and input/output, so they can focus on the specific purpose of their application.

To name you a practical example of where a Middleware can be useful, the [localStorage adapter](/advanced/local-storage) is a Middleware.
Instead of having to manually write/read from localStorage, a Middleware was written to do that for us.

If you need to automate something in your superstates, Middlewares can be the answer.

## TypeScript

```typescript
function myMiddleware<T = number>(input: IMiddlewareInput<T>): void {
  // ... your function
}

const count = superstate(0).use([myMiddleware])
```

*Feel free to change `T = number` to whatever you need.*
