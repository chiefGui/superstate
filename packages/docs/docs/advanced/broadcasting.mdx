# Broadcasting

If you want to do something when your state changes, broadcasting is the way to go.

## Subscribing to changes

To start listening to a **superstate**, you have to subscribe to it:

```ts
import { superstate } from '@superstate/core'

const count = superstate(0)

count.subscribe(newNow => {
  console.log(newNow)
})
```

And then, if you publish something:

```ts
count.publish(1)
```

The `console.log(newNow)` will be called.

By default, your subscriptions will target changes made to `now`. If you want to listen for changes made to the [draft state](/getting-started/drafts):

```ts {3}
count.subscribe(newDraft => {
  console.log(newDraft)
}, 'draft') // pay attention to the 'draft' here
```

In case you'd like to listen to changes made to both states, `now` and `draft`:

```ts {3}
count.subscribe(newDraft => {
  console.log(newDraft)
}, 'all') // pay attention to the 'all' here
```

:::info Remember
If your subscription is targeting a `draft`, only changes made via `.set()` will be caught. [Learn more &rarr;](/getting-started/drafts)
:::

## Unsubscribing

If you are not interested in changes anymore, you can call the function returned from `subscribe`:

```ts
const unsubscribe = count.subscribe(newNow => {
  console.log(newNow)
})

// do whatever you want

unsubscribe() // from now on, the previous subscriber is no more a subscriber
```

If you're feeling bold and want to unsubscribe all subscribers, you can call `unsubscribeAll`:

```ts
count.unsubscribeAll()
```

:::caution
When you call `unsubscribeAll()`, it's literally unsubscribe all&mdash;no subscriber is safe. Just use it if you know
what you are doing.
:::

## Exceptions

There are two exceptions for when changes won't be broadcasted.
One is if the next state value is the same as the previous one&mdash;**superstate** understands that nothing has changed,
hence there's no reason to broadcast.

The other exception is when you explictly specify `{ silent: true }` to either your `.publish()` or `.set()` calls:

```ts
count.publish(1, { silent: true }) // this won't broadcast
count.set(1, { silent: true }) // this won't broadcast
```

## React

If you want your components to re-render when your state changes, it's better to use the `useSuperState()` hook:

```tsx {7}
import { superstate } from '@superstate/core'
import { useSuperState } from '@superstate/react'

const count = superstate(0)

function MyComponent() {
  useSuperState(count)

  // Below it's just a sample effect
  // that will publish a change after 1 second
  // to demonstrate that this component will re-render
  // once the change is published.
  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      count.publish(10)
    }, 1000)
  }, [])

  return <div>{count.now}</div>
}
```
