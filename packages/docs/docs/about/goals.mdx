# Goals

In short:

- Sleek and comfortable API design
- Small bundle footprint and impact
- Extensible
- Do one thing, and do it well
- Always plug and play
- Explicitness over implicitness

**The ultimate goal of superstate is to make it easy reacting to variable changes.** In order to achieve that, **superstate** has to be compact
and cannot take decisions for you. It wants _you_ to be the chosen one; the admiral; the captain; the one in charge.

**superstate** is not opinionated either. It favors explicitness over implicitness because debugging time is pure waste.

**superstate** wants to be a tool. A fun one. Not a chore.
