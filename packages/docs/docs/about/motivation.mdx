# Motivation

In theory, state management should be something simple to deal with. You declare a variable and assign it a value that
we expect to change during the life of our application.

In practice though, if we think about it, most of the issues our applications have as they grow are somehow related
to bad state management&mdash;and this is the main reason why **superstate** was born.

To me, the author of **superstate**, it feels like the current solutions have gaps. Sometimes they relate to overly
complex solutions for small, simple problems; sometimes they relate to too much unnecessary boilerplate and verbosity.

What I dislike the most though is the excess of complicated words: context, reducer, store, selector,
derived state, state machines, etc.

It's too much pressure. And pressure leads to lack of motivation, that leads to
bad code, that leads to unsustainable codebase. A domino effect.

**superstate** however aims to be accessible. No boilerplate nor complicated words. Designed to be adored by beginners and
to don't put veterans down after a good, deserved vacation time.

**superstate** is an attempt to fill these mentioned gaps; it features an elegant and sleek API, and is
just enough opinionated to make you as productive as you can be.

Perhaps you should give it a try. :)
