# Introduction

**superstate** is an easy-to-use, plug-and-play state management library, that can be summarized into:

- ✨ Sleek API
- 💪 Strongly-typed, entirely written in TypeScript
- 💕 Friendly to beginners, charming to veterans
- 📃 Automatic drafts
- 🔄 Easy to "undo" state changes
- 🌎 Easy to manage global state
- 🎙️ Built-in broadcast system
- 🔌 Very extensible
- ✅ Works with Node apps, browser apps and React apps

## Motivation

There are several great and different solutions for JavaScript already. **superstate**, however, aims to fill a very straightforward gap: balance.

The reason **superstate** was born is because some solutions are way too overkill; others may lack functionality. Some solutions are way too verbose; others lack ease of use. **superstate** is not the most innovative, never-seen-before solution, but it was designed with ergonomics in mind, plus some functionality that sounds just indispensable when dealing with state management.

I'm pretty sure you're going to enjoy your time with **superstate**. =)
