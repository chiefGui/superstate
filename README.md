### Behold your next favorite state management library for the XXI century.
  
[Quick Start](https://superstate.dev/getting-started/first-state) · [Documentation](https://superstate.dev) · [Examples](https://superstate.dev/examples) · [API Reference](https://superstate.dev/api-reference/@superstate/core/superstate)
</div>

---

```shell
yarn add @superstate/core
```

---

#### ✨ **Simple, sleek & elegant API**

```ts
import { superstate } from "@superstate/core"

const count = superstate(0)

count.set(5)

console.log(count.now()) // 5
```

_Yep, that simple. No PhD required._

#### 🤯 Mindlessly easy to share state across your entire app

```ts
// count.ts
import { superstate } from "@superstate/core"

export const count = superstate(0)

// calculator.ts
import { count } from "./count.ts"

count.set(5)

// app.ts
import { count } from "./count.ts"

// When calculator.ts changes count, it'll call the callback below! :D
count.subscribe((value) => {
  console.log(value)
})
```

_The trick is the `export` keyword: to share your state, all you have to do is exporting and importing it._

#### 📐 Designed with ergonomy and developer wellness in mind

**superstate** puts the developer first&mdash;from the beginner to the veteran. No changes are made without thorough consideration and confidence that working with superstate is pure pleasure.

#### 🧩 Fully extensible

Instead of building **superstate** with lots of useless opinionated features, the idea is to give you the tools to expand it as much as you need&mdash;and only _when_ you need. Middlewares and Extensions are at your service.

#### 📝 Built-in Drafts System

Great UX doesn't have to be a burden to build. With the built-in Drafts System, you can give your users second chances without spending an extra day on it.

```ts
const count = superstate(0)

count.sketch(5)
console.log(count.draft()) // 5
console.log(count.now()) // 0

count.publish()
console.log(count.draft()) // undefined
console.log(count.now()) // 5
```

#### 🤘 Simple enough for prototypes and scalable enough for the world's next big thing

Regardless of the scale of your project, **superstate** _will_ fit. It is very compact for prototypes, but if your app hits big, **superstate** follows along. Have an ongoing application? It's all right&mdash;**superstate** can be incrementally adopted so you don't have to worry if the first rails are already built.

#### ⌨️ Proudly written in TypeScript

Building **superstate** without TypeScript was never an option.

#### ⚛️ Deadly simple integration with React apps

```tsx
import { superstate } from '@superstate/core'
import { useSuperState } from '@superstate/react'

const count = superstate(0)

export const MyComponent = () => {
  useSuperState(count)

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Count: ${count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => count.set(prev => prev + 1))>Increase</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

You read it right: calling the `useSuperState(count)` hook is all you need to make your component re-render when `count` increases.

#### 🌐 Works in the browser or in Node environments

Browser-only apps, hybrid apps (such as [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)), Node apps... check, check, check!
